GitTagger: A tiny little library for tagging Capistrano deploys with Git

GitTagger will build a tag marked with a namespace, a timestamp, a build number (to differentiate multiple deploys with the same timestamp), and a commit. This should give you all the information you need to pinpoint exactly what and when a certain Capistrano deploy points to.

To use:
@git = GitTagger.new("namespace")
@git.tag # => git tag namespace-20091026-01-6d87ee

Or to tag with a specific name:
@git.tag("tag-name") # => git tag tag-name

You can also push tags to your remote repository:
@git.push # => git push --tags --force

Then, if you have too many tags, you can clean them up:
@git.clean(10) # => Keeps the last 10 tags, deletes the rest.

A typical way to use the GitTagger is in an after :deploy block in a Capistrano recipe:
after :deploy do
  @git = GitTagger.new("namespace")
  @git.tag
  @git.tag("latest")
  @git.clean(10)
  @git.push
end

This will make a unique tag for this commit, tag it with "latest", delete all but the last 10 tags, and push it all up to origin.
